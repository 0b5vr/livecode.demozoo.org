# Shader Summary

List of demoscene shader livecoding events. (Shader Showdown, Shader Jam, Shader Royale)

## How to Contribute

Anybody can add an event by simply doing a Pull Request of the json file of your event in the `/data`.

Same way to update, enrich data from an existing file, just create a Pull Request of the change.

The json schema is available here : [./meta/event.schema.json](./meta/event.schema.json) , but you can also take any other file in [./data](./data) as a base example.

A more readable version of the schema is available here [./doc/schema.html](./doc/schema.html)
